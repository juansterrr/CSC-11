while loops pre-test loop body may run xero times!
do/while = post test body will execute at least once 
do_expr:
= loop body 
cmp operand1, operand2 
b{cc*} DO EXPR 
code after the do/while 
examp;es for exper in your label: 
r1>r2 with expr as : r1_gt_r2
make the label of the while loop as verbertious as possible 
while (r1 is <= 10)
{
  r0= r0+r1
  r1++;
  
}
