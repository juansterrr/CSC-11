Agenda: Intro to ARM Assembly 

Quiz 1 and 2 will be available tomorrow after noon, due date TBD 

If you want to set up the PI at home, use secure shell ssh 
Creating a new user; type in demo
Sudo- Super user do, Type in "Sudo adduser demo" to override the the root or group 
"Sudo chmod go-xrw" g-group, o-other, x- execute, r-read, w-write, -:deny
.s- assembly lang source file extension 
g++; source_file.ext {-g, -o} optional-  -g: generate debug info, -o: tells linker to name the executable file 
           ^ creates an internal file in memory called source_file.$
               ^ gas/as gas-gnu assembly 
                         as-assembler
.global- makes all labels in code globally visible to linker
.section - Indicates the beginning of section
.data - holds non-constant, initialized data 
(data is embedded in executable file)
.text- holds all program code
.rodata- all constant variables; "ro" stands for read only
.bss - hold non-constant, utilized data 
(data is not embedded in the executiable file)
.align tells the linker how to align data and code on byte bounderies 
In assebly variable names and function names need to be converted to a label
Syntax for label, "label name:"
Push {Lr}
 ^ pseudo instruction
"Lr" holds the address of the next instruction after the function call is done
