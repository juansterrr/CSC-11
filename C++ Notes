"IF" statements, utilize:

"!=" value is to check if two values are not equal to eachother 
A function has a job to do something, every function starts with main
To create another function, go outside main, hit return; "printSomething" 
"()" add parameters if the function needs additional information; add two "{}" this is the body of the function 
void means you are not looking for anything in return
Anytime you want to use a specific function, type it into your main function in order for it to know which job you would like for it to
perform
function prototyping: later on C++ will know a function is created
Whenever you are making parameters, list the type of data then give it names
Making multiple parameters, whenenver you want per say, two numbers, seperate them within the same parameter with a comma
Classes, are another way to group your functions which makes it easier in your function later on 
Public: you can use it outside of your class, known as the access specifiyer
Need to make an object of the class you are trying to use, "BuckysClass buckysObject; buckysObject.coolSaying
String is basically just text
